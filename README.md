## Riot Account Manager

A lightweight JavaFX application that helps users store and manage multiple Riot Games accounts for League of Legends. 
Account data is saved locally using an embedded SQLite database. This project is built using Java 21 and JavaFX.

### Features

- Add, edit, and remove Riot accounts
- Secure local storage using SQLite
- Launch Riot Client directly from the app


For the application to work properly, the official Riot Games client (Riot Client) must be installed on your system.  
This is necessary because our app relies on the Riot API and requires the Riot Client for proper authentication and functionality.

You can download the Riot Client from the official website:
